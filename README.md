# Onebot

**WARNING:** The developer of Onebot is not responsible for damage caused by plugins! Please use verified plugins only!

Requires these Node.js modules to properly function without giving you errors:

* `js-yaml` for the configuration file
* `discord.io` for pretty much everything the bot does
* `fs` for managing the filesystem (config)
* `path` for the location of the plugins folder
* `include-all` for loading the plugins
* `jsdom` for loading jQuery
* `node-notifier` for cross platform notifications
* `esrever`for string reversal

Additional modules may be needed for nonbundled plugins; please consult the developer's website for more information.

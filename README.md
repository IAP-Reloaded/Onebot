# Onebot

**WARNING:** The developer of Onebot is not responsible for damage caused by plugins! Please use verified plugins only!

Requires these Node.js modules to properly function without giving you errors:

* `js-yaml` for the configuration file
* `discord.io` for pretty much everything the bot does
* `fs` for managing the filesystem (config)

Additional modules may be needed for nonbundled plugins; please consult the developer's website for more information.
